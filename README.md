# Coding-Challenge-14
I'm creating a webpage to display unresolved customer support tickets from an external API. I'll use async/await for fetching data and implement error handling to manage network issues or missing data. If no tickets are found, I'll throw a custom error stating, “No unresolved tickets available,” ensuring users are informed appropriately.
